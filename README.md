# AI Projects - Genz Educatewing Summer Internship 2025

## Overview

This repository contains the AI-based projects completed by **B. Raju** during the **Summer Internship 2025** at **Genz Educatewing**. The internship involved applying key Artificial Intelligence concepts through two practical projects:

1. **Sentiment Analysis using CNN**
2. **YOLO-Based Object Detection**

These projects also fulfill requirements for the **7th Semester Computer Science and Technology (CST)** course at **G. Pulla Reddy Engineering College (GPREC)**.

## Project Details

### Project 1: Sentiment Analysis Using CNN

**Objective:**  
Build a sentiment analysis model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify text data such as movie reviews into positive or negative categories.

**Key Tasks:**
- Installed libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NLTK
- Used the IMDB dataset from Keras (or similar public dataset)
- Preprocessed data: tokenization, padding
- Built and trained a CNN model for classification
- Evaluated model performance (accuracy, F1-score)
- Compiled a comprehensive report covering methodology and challenges

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, Pandas  
**Dataset:** IMDB movie reviews (or other public datasets)  
**Directory:** `/SentimentAnalysis`

### Project 2: YOLO-Based Object Detection

**Objective:**  
Implement an object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect and classify objects in images.

**Key Tasks:**
- Installed tools: Python, OpenCV, PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Used standard datasets (COCO, PASCAL VOC, or custom annotated data)
- Studied YOLO versions (e.g., YOLOv8, YOLOv7)
- Trained a YOLO model with necessary tweaks
- Evaluated using mean Average Precision (mAP)
- Created a detailed report on implementation, challenges, and outcomes

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, OpenCV, PyTorch/TensorFlow  
**Datasets:** COCO, PASCAL VOC, or custom dataset  
**Directory:** `/ObjectDetection`
